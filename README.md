# 🔮 Crime Rate Forecasting Web Application

![Home Page](screenshots/home_page.png)

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning-powered web application** that forecasts crime rates for different cities and crime categories.  
Using historical crime datasets (2015–2024), the system predicts future crime counts (e.g., 2025–2027) with the help of **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost Regressor** models.  

The app provides an easy-to-use **web interface** where users can select a city, crime type, and year to get real-time predictions.  
This tool can support **public safety planning, resource allocation, and policy making** by analyzing crime trends.
